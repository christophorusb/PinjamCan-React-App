## Some pre-requisites
Need to install Node.js and npm, here is the link : https://nodejs.org/en/

Need to install yarn. Once npm is installed, just type this command in cmd 
```
npm install --global yarn
```
to check if yarn is already installed, type this in cmd
```
yarn --version
```
## Cloning the project to your local machine

Yes, you cannot immediately clone from remote repo and use it smh. We gotta install the dependencies required from this project to your local machine.
So after cloning the project, navigate to the working directory, open the code editor in that directory (VSCode rocks yeah!), and in the terminal type this out

```
npm install
```
## Email me for .env file

## Optional : If you somehow cannot use yarn commands in terminal due to PSSecurityException Error

run this in terminal
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

```

voilla  i think you're good to go for now. README will always be updated if needed
